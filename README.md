# SignalK NMEA0183 Voyage Data Recorder

Entirely based on the SignalK-to-NMEA0183 plugin, this plugin merely converts SignalK data into a selection of NMEA0183 messages and logs them into a file.

Background of this plugin is to log (RMC, DPT) sentences to use for bathymetric purposes.

Primarily built to be used in conjunction with https://github.com/marcobergman/depthwaypoints
